# Stuck-in-the-Mud
Each player starts with 3 dice and keeps rolling until they run out of dice. Rolling a 2 or a 5 causes you to lose a dice. Score is calculated by adding up all dice rolls that weren't 2s or 5s. When all players lose dice, the game is over. The player with the highest score wins. Have fun!
