# Stuck-in-the-Mud
Each player starts with 3 dice and keeps rolling them until they run out of dice. Rolling a 2 or a 5 causes you to lose a dice. Score is calculated by adding up all dice rolls that weren't 2 or 5. When all players lose dice, player with highest score wins. Make sure you download all the dice pics and put them in the same file as the Java code. Have fun!
